# Problem Sets 5 and 6

In Problem Set 5 we will be exploring n-grams, collocations, and a new measure of word importance, TF-IDF.

In Problem Set 6, using the same data, we will build word2vec models, compare those models to a large word2vec model, and explore a few different methods for sentence embeddings.

Remember that I drop your lowest problem set score!

Both problem sets are due Monday, November 27, at 11:59pm EST.
