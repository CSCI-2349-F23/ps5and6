# Problem Sets 5 and 6

In problem set 5 we will be exploring n-grams, collocations, and a new measure of word importance, TF-IDF.

In problem set 6, using the same data, we will build word2vec models, compare those models to a large word2vec model, and explore a few different methods for sentence embeddings.

Remember that I drop your lowest problem set score!

## Data
We'll be using the same data, which you can get from here. Here's what you should do to pre-process the data for your work in both problem sets.
